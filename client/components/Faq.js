         <h3> Why does Gurgle exist? </h3>
         <p>
         Inspired to reduce the impact on our plant, to lessen our footprint and to support local communities, Gurgl is the brain-child of a newly qualified web-developer who wanted an excuse to practise her skills. The idea was solidified by excitable conversations and dinners with friends and their new borns...
         </p>
         <p>
         With little encouragement the developer set about creating a business model, a network and a website and now dreams of bringing Gurgl to anyone who can benefit from the borrow-a-bib service they provide. So please, spread the news,
         </p>

         <h3> How does it work? </h3>
         <p>
         We take donations of preloved clothing from individuals and organisations. So that you can flick through our catalogue and choose the items you would like to borrow. Select them and add them to your basket. Once you are done, you simply complete the details and we will send you your items. They are due back 2 months from the day you book them - or when your little-ones grow out of them. Once you return the items you have borrowed, you can borrow more!
